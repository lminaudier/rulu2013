Last but not least, you can now [get your ticket](https://tito.io/rulu/coding-dojo-rulu-2013/) for the Coding Dojo at RuLu!

There is no extra charge, but you will need a valid ticket for RuLu 2013 to register.

The Coding Dojo will be hosted by [Haikel GuÃ©mar](http://twitter.com/hguemar). To make it short, you will improve your skills in Test-Driven Development and make use of the [SOLID principles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29). You will practice with *a pair* (in Pair Programming mode) during a serie of timeboxed *katas*.

About the Coding Dojo
---------------------

Don't know what a Coding Dojo is? Want to know more about the schedule? Haikel gives us a quick introduction to the Coding Dojo.

Fabien: What is a Coding Dojo?

> Haikel: It's merely a gathering of programmers practicing their craft without worrying about deadlines or pointy-haired bosses, a safe place to practice, experiment and learn new skills. More importantly, it's a place to have fun together!
> The basic premise is: professionals practice to improve their skills, why shouldn't programmers? Kent Beck defined himself as "a good programmer with great habits". You can't improve or build habits without practice, and that includes deliberate practice.

What is the schedule for this workshop?

> I'll start by presenting the concept of Coding Dojo and give out a few pointers on how to host one. Since we have enough time, we'll practice two katas. Usually, a kata takes place as follows:
> 1. presentation of the kata
> 2. timeboxed iterations (followed by intermediate retrospective)
> 3. final retrospective

What will I learn?

> You'll practice pair programming, Test-Driven Development, emergent design, etc. The chosen katas will also focus on [SOLID principles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29) and using test doubles. Then you should be able to host your own Coding Dojo, either at your workplace or user groups.

What skills are required to get in?

> Very little: you should know one programming language and how to use your testing framework.

What setup is required?

> Bring a working programming environment with a testing framework.  Anything is fine (IDE, text editors, etc.) as long as you're comfortable with it.
> If you don't know any testing framework, i suggest that you take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with [minitest](http://docs.seattlerb.org/minitest/). Minitest is a full-fledged testing framework included in the Ruby standard library. It supports many testing features like TDD, BDD, mocking and benchmarking.
