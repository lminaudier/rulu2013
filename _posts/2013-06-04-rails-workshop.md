About this workshop
----------------------

To get a better overview, Damien Mathieu answered a few questions about the workshop.

Fabien: Why a Rails 4 and Ruby 2 workshop?

> Damien: While the changes in Rails 4 have less impact on your application's code than what we had three years ago with Rails 3, there are still significant changes.
>
> The biggest change, and main reason for the major version, is that Ruby 1.8 support has been dropped. You need Ruby 1.9.3 or above.
>
> So you not only need to get up to speed with the changes on Rails 4, but also the ones on 1.9. And as there aren't much breaking changes between 1.9 and 2.0, we thought, just as many others around the globe that it'd be more useful to you get straight to 2.0.

What is the schedule for this workshop?

> After a brief presentation of the main changes, we will split in small groups of 2-3 people, each group with a coach. You will then be able to start hacking on awesome stuff.
>
> This workshop is intended for people with a minimum background on Rails.

What will I learn?

> In this workshop, you will spend some time hacking with the new features provided by Rails 4 and Ruby 2.
>
> Among other things, you will discover :
>
> * How to use strong parameters to secure your app
> * How to add live streaming to your app
> * How to use the new view caching mechanism
> * What are the new ruby refinements
> * How to use the new keyword arguments

What skills are required to get in?

> This workshop is intended for people with a minimum background in Rails.
>
> If you know what `def` means, what a controller is, and how to implement one, you should be fine.

What setup is required?

> You can come with a PC or a Mac. Linux is way better than Windows.
>
> Ruby 2.0 should be installed on your machine before you come. You can install it with [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install/).
>
> Our application will require a SQL database. So you should install [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) on your machine too.
>
> We'll cover up the rest together!

Thank you all!
