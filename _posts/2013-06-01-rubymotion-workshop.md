About this workshop
-------------------

Want to know more about this workshop? We've asked a few questions to Laurent.

Fabien: What is RubyMotion?

> Laurent: RubyMotion is a toolkit that lets you write full-fledged iOS apps in Ruby, for iPhone and iPad. Actually, since version 2.0, you can also write OS X apps with it!

What is the content of the workshop?

> We will introduce the iOS system, RubyMotion, then write our very first iOS app: a timezone converter! The workshop content is derived from our official training material. We will do the first exercise.

What skills are required to get in?

> You need to know Ruby, that's all!

What setup do I need?

> Just bring your Mac, we will provide you with a special license just for the training.

What if I want to purchase a RubyMotion license?

> If you are interested in RubyMotion after the training and want to purchase a real license, we will offer you a discount.

Thanks a lot Laurent!
