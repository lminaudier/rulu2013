  RuLu 2012 has been such a success, going well beyond the expectations
  of its audience, that we had to run a third edition!
</p>
<p>
  Today, we're delighted to announce the official launch of the
  <strong>third edition</strong> of Ruby Lugdunum
  aka <strong>RuLu 2013</strong>,
  which will take place on <strong>June 20-21</strong> in
  <strong><a href="http://www.en.lyon-france.com/Discover-Lyon/Culture-History" target="_blank">Lyon</a></strong>.

<p>
  We will follow the well-known recipe of RuLu, which has made a reputation
  of being the greatest Ruby conference in the French provinces: best talks
  of the moment (conducted in English), gorgeous venues, great atmosphere
  and nice food (Lyon is the French capital of gastronomy).

<p>
  There will be about 200 attendees from Lyon and other parts of France,
  and other European countries, providing an opportunity to know each other
  during these 2 days.
</p>
<p>
  On <a href="/schedule">Thursday June 20<sup>th</sup></a>, there will be 8
  speakers at the former
  <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/geADY" target="_blank">Manufacture des Tabacs</a>,
  now part of the University.
  Lunch and refreshments will be provided which would leave enough time
  for networking.

<p>
  At the end of the day, the dinner will be at
  <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/geADY" target="_blank">Le Koodeta</a> restaurant,
  a good place for enjoying food and drink while watching sunset.
</p>
<p>
  On <a href="/schedule">Friday June 21<sup>st</sup></a>,
  the second day of RuLu, there will be several workshops to practice further.
</p>
<p>
  After the official closing of RuLu, some fun is still in store,
  as June 21<sup>st</sup> coincides with the French
  <a href="http://www.fetedelamusique.culture.fr/en/International/presentation/" target="_blank">FÃªte de la Musique</a> (World Music Day).
  There will be a lot of live bands in the streets of
  <a href="http://www.en.lyon-france.com/Discover-Lyon/Culture-History" target="_blank">Old Lyon</a>.
