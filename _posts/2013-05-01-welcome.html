  Today, we're delighted to announce the official launch of the
  <strong>third edition</strong> of Ruby Lugdunum
  aka <strong>RuLu 2013</strong>,
  which will take place on <strong>June 20-21</strong> in
  <strong><a href="http://www.en.lyon-france.com/Discover-Lyon/Culture-History" target="_blank">Lyon</a></strong>.

<p>
  We will follow the proven formula of RuLu, which has established a solid reputation
  amongst Ruby conference in the French provinces: curated talks (in English), gorgeous venues, great atmosphere
  and excellent food (Lyon is the French capital of gastronomy)!
</p>
