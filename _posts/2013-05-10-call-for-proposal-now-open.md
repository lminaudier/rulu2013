We are inviting the Ruby community to submit talks for RuLu 2013.

Want to come as a speaker? Have a look at [CFP guidelines](/cfp/) and then fill in the [CFP form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1a9KqfkiJ73x-amtUzM_rvkk0F3EXSPJW9mZ5vSd6SHY/viewform).
We will reply by email as quick as possible.

RuLu is a Ruby conference, so we are mainly (but not only) looking for Ruby topics.

All talks are in English and are 25-30 minutes long.

Please note we will only have 8 talks, so we may have to refuse your talk *even if it awesome*!
