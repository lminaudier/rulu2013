Call for proposal
=================

We are inviting the Ruby community to submit talks for RuLu 2013.
[This Call for Proposals](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1a9KqfkiJ73x-amtUzM_rvkk0F3EXSPJW9mZ5vSd6SHY/viewform) (CFP) will close on May 24th.

Topics
------

RuLu is a Ruby conference, so we are mainly looking for Ruby topics.
We also accept non-Ruby or non-technical talks if we feel it would interest Rubyists.

Guidelines
----------

All talks are in English.

Talks are 25-30 minutes long, no more. Then you will have up to 5 minutes for Q&A.

Make sure to fill in the CFP with precise words. But don't over do it. Just be yourself!

Don't forget to tell us *why the Ruby community does care* about your talk. And don't forget to tell us about the story you plan to tale, as good stories often make good talks.

Remember we will only have 8 talks for this edition, so we may have to refuse your talk even if we think it's going to be a great one! And we already know it's going to be a hard time selecting the talks!

What you get
------------

One you are selected as a speaker at RuLu 2013, you get:

- entrance to the conference
- invitation for speakers diner
- 2 nights at the hotel, from June 19 to June 21, with other speakers
- our assistance to get to Lyon, travel information, etc.

You've got special needs? Just tell us and we will see what we can do for you!

Slides and videos
-----------------

All talks will be recorded and published on the internet for free, including your slides and everything you show on your screen. We’ll ask you to make your materials and recording available under a creative commons license (no commercial reuse) or alike, to share them along with the video of your talk.

We do this for the benefit of the larger Ruby community and those who can’t make it to the conference. Let us know if you are not comfortable with that and we will work things out.
