      <p>Sleep: we all do it, and yet somehow it's hard (as most of us can attest every morning).  It's also really relevant: as thinkers, creators, and problem solvers, anything that makes our brains less effective matters.  Missed sleep makes a difference -- even two fewer hours a night quickly produce measurable cognitive impairment.  Things get more interesting when we look at why it's so hard: our sleep cycles are determined by our internal clocks, which often put us in conflict with society's timetables, leaving many of us in a state of "social jet lag", as if we'd been traveling a timezone or more every day.  That's not how any of us want to code (or live), I think, and by understanding how and why so many of us are constantly tired, we can start to make things better.</p>

      <p>You know you should be testing all the time, but do you know why you are testing all the time? One of the main benefits of testing all the time is that it lets you refactor with impunity. Unfortunately too many times we leave the “refactor” out of the red-green-refactor. In this talk I will convince you that you should be refactoring all the time and I’ll show you some of the techniques on how you can do it. With good refactoring techniques and regular refactoring even the hairiest of codebases can be tamed.</p>

      <p>Odors are communication devices. They exist for a reason and are usually trying to tell us something.</p>
      <p>Our code smells and it is trying to tell us what is wrong. Does a test case require a lot of setup? Maybe the code being tested is doing too much, or it is not isolated enough for the test? Does an object have an abundance of instance variables? Maybe it should be split into multiple objects? Is a view brittle? Maybe it is too tightly coupled to a model, or maybe the logic needs abstracted into an object that can be tested?</p>
      <p>In this talk, I will walk through code from projects that I work on every day, looking for smells that indicate problems, understanding why it smells, what the smell is trying to tell us, and how to refactor it.</p>

      <p>The hardest part of joining an open source project for a professional
      developer is being completely transparent on a mailing list, and
      submitting your work to public peer review. When you are used to talking
      about technical details with your manager and colleagues, writing an
      email to a mailing list can be very daunting: Am I exposing some
      confidential information here? Have I made a mistake which someone will
      criticise? Is this message important enough to make an announcement on a
      public mailing list?</p>

      <p>I call this "Shy Developer Syndrome". Developers used to working in a
      commercial software development environment can clam up when asked to
      work in public.</p>

      <p>There are some straightforward ways to help experienced developers gain
      confidence in working in public forums, and gain the respect of their
      peers in open source projects. This presentation will outline some of
      the strategies which have worked in the past for me.</p>

      Everyone knows the rule “fat models, thin controllers”. It’s really
      efficient when it comes to simple applications, but when we have an
      enterprise application, suddenly our models seem to look a bit
      overweight. Actually they are fat and ugly. I want to show a few
      examples of using DCI architectural pattern (which is complementary to
      MVC pattern) with Rails as a potential solution for these problems. My
      personal goal is to encourage people to experiment with the code and
      thinking outside the box (Rails box). Start thinking through domain
      model, not database design, to look at Datamapper pattern and DDD
      concepts. However, DCI is a good start to enter this enterprise
      world.</p>

      <p>In times when applications get more and more split up into small
      pieces that have to communicate with each other it’s critical to have
      systems in place that make this communication as trouble-free as
      possible. This talk covers what we did at Engine Yard to improve our
      inter service communication and how you can apply that to your own
      infrastructure.</p>

      <p>Ruby developers are living in the world of Active Record. No matter
      what ORM you’re using, it’s an implementation of the Active Record
      pattern. There’s been a recent discussion in our community about
      separating business logic from the persistence concerns. People are
      experimenting with different approaches but they still use an
      ActiveRecord ORM under the hood.</p>

      <p>In this presentation I will give you an introduction to the development
      of DataMapper 2 - the first true implementation of the Data Mapper
      pattern in Ruby language. I will talk a little bit about ORM patterns
      and show you core parts of DM2 that already exist and the ones we’re
      going to build soon.</p>
